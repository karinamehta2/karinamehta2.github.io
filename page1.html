    <h2>About me:</h2>
    <div id="aboutme">Hello, my name is Karina! I want to talk about my favorite animal. It is capybara. There are a lot of reasons why people like them, but here are mine: Capybaras are known for their friendly interactions with humans and other animals, often seen lounging in groups or forming bonds with various species, which highlights their amiable character. With large, expressive eyes, round faces, and a soft, furry body, capybaras exude a sense of warmth and approachability. Their size—being the largest rodent in the world—adds to their unique appeal, as they can be both cuddly and majestic.  </div>
