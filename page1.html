    <h2>About me:</h2>
    <div id="aboutme">Hello, my name is Karina!  I am 21 years old from Russia studying Data Science. I want to talk about my favorite animal. It is capybara. There are a lot of reasons why people like them, but here are mine: Capybaras are known for their friendly interactions with humans and other animals, often seen lounging in groups or forming bonds with various species, which highlights their amiable character. With large, expressive eyes, round faces, and a soft, furry body, capybaras spread a sense of warmth and approachability. Their size, being the largest rodent in the world, adds to their unique appeal, as they can be both cuddly and majestic. My whole TikTok page is flooded with videos of them. This summer I purchased a big plushie of capybara and finally saw one live at the Moscow Central Zoo. They turned out to be smaller than I expected, but I have found out that in Japan and Australia they get really big. So my next destination is Japan, so I can finally see them in their natural habitat. I also really want to go to Nagoya, where deers are walking around the park and tourists have the ability to feed them apples.
